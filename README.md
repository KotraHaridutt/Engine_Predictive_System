# ✈️ Turbofan Engine Predictive Maintenance

This project is an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning solution to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines, based on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Unscheduled aircraft maintenance is a primary driver of cost and delays in the aviation industry. This project aims to:
1.  **Analyze** sensor data to identify patterns of degradation.
2.  **Build** a predictive model to forecast the RUL of an engine.
3.  **Develop** a cost-benefit model for maintenance scheduling.
4.  **Deploy** a live dashboard for fleet monitoring.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, SQL (SQLite)
* **ML Model:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest)
* **Dashboard:** Streamlit
* **Data:** NASA C-MAPSS (FD001 dataset)
